                            <p>The Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE) program is a bus-mounted camera system that
                                monitors and issues violations to vehicles that blocks bus lanes and routes. The
                                purpose of the ACE program is to improve bus speeds and reliability by reducing the 
                                possible obstructions.

                                Due to the large amounts of data in the MTA ACE Violations dataset, we decided to
                                narrowed our data down to focus on the occurences within the Manhathan's Central Business District
                                (CBD) zone which 
                                also covers the congestion pricing zone. Congestion pricing went into effect
                                January 5, 2025

                                In this project, we examine the effects of congestion pricing on 
                                the number of ACE violations for exempt vehicles, and breaking it down
                                by monthly trends as well as locations. We also explore the effects of 
                                congestion pricing on bus speeds as well as CitiBike ridership.

                                <p>I learned more about how we deal with data in the world / how we can put it to good use, and improved my website development skills. Learning about MTA Open Data and visualizing the problems at hand using tools like IPYNB and HTML helped me grasp a better understanding of Data Science as a whole. I enjoyed my time collaborating with others who had a better grasp of data than I did and learning from their insights!</p>

                            of congestion pricing. We first separated Manhathan buses from the dataset that contained buses throughout
                            the boroughs which we then found the amount of exempt vehicle violations that has been recorded by ACE.
                            We separated this dataset into two, before the implementation of congestion pricing and after to get a better
                            picture of ACE's role in our bus system.

                                Emergency vehicles make up the majority of the exempt vehicle violations. This data 
                                includes medical, law enforcement, and fire vehicles.

                                Using the map, we took note of exempt vehicle violation clusters. 
                                For example, there is a dense patch at 2nd Ave, between East
                                22nd and 23rd street that is made up by emergency vehicles. We conclude that
                                this is likely due to the hospitals in the area. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                We have around 23 months of data before congestion pricing. 
                                On average, there is around 5,360 violations from exempt vehicles per month.
                                So far, we have 7 months of data after the implementation of congestion pricing. 
                                On average, there is around 24,219 violations from exempt vehicles per month.

                                The ratio for the parantransit and "other" exempt vehicles stayed relatively consistent 
                                pre and post congestion pricing. While pre-congestion emergency vehicles were far in the lead, 
                                post-congestion it was much more similar to a 1:1 ratio for emergency vehicles compared to commercial
                                vehicles, each made up about 1/3 of the occurences.

                                Most bus routes speed were either maintained or slightly faster after congestion pricing. Bus routes like M101 and M2 stayed relatively similar while M23+, M14+, M23+, and M34+ gained speed, suggesting congestion pricing did not slow buses down. 
                            </li>

                                M14A+ stands out as it recorded a significant increase in speed compared to before congestion pricing. This suggest that M14A+ routes which runs primarily along 34th Street in Midtown, benefited from reduced east-west traffic congestion. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After congestion pricing, the difference between the slowest route, M42 and the fastest M14A+ became sharper. Routes that have a strong priority features benefited more while routes without those feaures saw little to no change.

                                Congestion pricing on its own isn't enough, with an improvement of stronger bus lanes and better enforcement will ensure all routes not just few will experience smoother and reliable service.

                                lot more citibike ridership in CBD zone after congestion pricing

                                We compared bike speeds in non-CBD areas and the CBD zone to see the difference
